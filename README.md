### What I learned

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
@media (max-width: 650px){
article {
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    height: 610px;
    flex-basis: unset;
}
```

### Continued development
I'd like to continue focusing on learning more about pseudo-selectors and animation in future projects.
